# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# first_group = Center.create!(name:'amos', office:'nairobi', staff:'staff1', active:'active', submitted_on:)
# second_group = Center.create!(name:'stephen', office:'mombasa', staff:'staff2', active:'active', submitted_on:)
# third_group = Center.create!(name:'brenda', office:'kitale', staff:'staff3', active:'active', submitted_on: )
# fifth_group = Center.create!(name:'antoney', office:'mombasa', staff:'staff5', active:'active', submitted_on: )
# fourth_group = Center.create!(name:'brian', office:'taveta', staff:'staff4', active:'active', submitted_on: )

# puts 'Group seeds done  ..'
